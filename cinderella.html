    <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        There once lived a gentleman who married for his
        second wife the proudest woman ever seen.
        She had two daughters of the same spirit, who were indeed like her in all things.
    </p>
    <p>
        No sooner was the wedding over than the stepmother
        began to show her ill temper; she could not bear her young step-daughter's 
        gentle ways.
